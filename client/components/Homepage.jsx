        Our mission is to promote community engagement and reduce waste! If you
        have extra food at home that you&#39;re afraid you won&#39;t use or will go bad,
        share it and it will be posted to the food to share page. If there&#39;s
        something you need, ask for it and it will be shared to the food needs
        page.
